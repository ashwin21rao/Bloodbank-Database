# Bloodbank Database

A model database of a blood bank. Supports all relevant queries (see [database_design.pdf](Schema/database_design.pdf)).

## Database Purpose

This project presents a <strong>Blood Bank Database Management System (BBDBMS)</strong>. The system keeps track of data in all stages of blood donation from donor participation to providing blood to patients in hospitals. The system keeps a record of donor information, details of donation, properties of blood donated, results of blood testing, processed blood components, stock of blood in blood inventory/storage and data about orders placed by hospitals.

## Intended Audience

This database is meant to be used by blood donation centers for the overall management of data pertaining to different stages in the blood donation process. Functions of the database are described in the functional requirements section.
